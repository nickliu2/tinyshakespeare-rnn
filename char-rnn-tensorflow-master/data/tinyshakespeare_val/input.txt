Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.

Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;

Gloves as sweet as damask roses;

Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;

And by that loss your daughter is made queen.

Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.

The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury

True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:

That owes two buckets, filling one another,
